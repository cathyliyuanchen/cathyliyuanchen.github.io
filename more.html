      <h3> Why 6 majors </h3>
      My goal for undergraduate studies was to broadly gain insights in a range of academic fields related to computing, logic, and cognition. While completing the majors was not necessary for this purpose, I did so because the major requirements were straight-forward guidelines to obtain a holistic view of the academic area. It was a rewarding journey: I gained interesting perspectives on human learning, how information is structured in systems, and how systems evolve over time; I also discovered my passion in computer science and decided to do research in ML.

      <h3> After 2020 </h3>
      After graduating from UC Berkeley, I was a ML research assistant for a few months and a software engineer for a year before joining FAIR. I decided that I want to pursue a career in research, and will hopefully start grad school in Fall 2023!
